# Installing R Packages

## Installing R packages

We get a lot of requests to install R packages. While we will continue to do this, users should also be aware that they can install R packages for themselves. This documentation shows you how to install R packages locally \(without root access\) on Oscar.

### Installing an R package

First load the R version that you want to use the package with:

```text
module load R/3.4.3_mkl
```

Start an R session

```text
R
```

Note some packages will require code to be compiled so it is best to do R packages installs on the login node.

To install the package 'wordcloud':

```text
> install.packages("wordcloud", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
```

You will see a warning:

```text
Warning in install.packages("wordcloud", repos = "http://cran.r-project.org") :
  'lib = "/gpfs/runtime/opt/R/3.4.2/lib64/R/library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead?  (y/n) 
```

Answer `y` . If you have not installed any R packages before you will see the following message:

```text
Would you like to create a personal library
~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4
to install packages into?  (y/n) 
```

Answer `y` . The package will then be installed. If the install is successful you will see a message like:

```text
** R
** data
** preparing package for lazy loading
** help
*** installing help indices
** building package indices
** testing if installed package can be loaded
* DONE (wordcloud)
```

If the installation was not successful you will see a message like:

```text
Warning message:
In install.packages("wordcloud", repos = "http://cran.r-project.org") :
  installation of package ‘wordcloud’ had non-zero exit status

```

There is normally information in the message that gives the reason why the install failed. Look for the word `ERROR` in the message.

Possible reasons for an installation failing include:

* Other software is needed to build the R package, e.g. the R package `rgdal` needs `gdal` so you have to do `module load gdal`
* A directory needs deleting from a previous failed installation.

### Removing an R package

Start an R session:

```text
R
```

To remove the 'wordcloud' package:

```text
> remove.packages("wordcloud")
```
