  The following is a brief example of building a tensorflow container from a
  DockerHub recipe, and using via the batch command to run a tensorflow project
  without loading any specific modules.

# Example - Tensorflow

## Getting the Container Built

First, I go to the official dockerHub Tensorflow page, and decide on which release I am interested in. For this example, I will use the latest python3 deployment. Following the instructions provided in the [Building Images](building-images.md) section:

```
singularity build <finalImageName>.simg docker://<dockerHubURL>
```

becomes

```
singularity build tf-py3.simg docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-py3
```

Once entering the command, singularity will begin to compile the container. During the build process, the .singularity directory is used as a temporary cache location. Be aware of this is if you are nearing or at the hard quota limit in your home directory.

```text
[mk100@login003 ~]$ singularity build tf-py3.simg docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-py3
Docker image path: index.docker.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-py3
Cache folder set to /gpfs_home/mk100/.singularity/docker

Once built, you will have a new file in your current directory named tf-py3.simg. 

## Running Our Tensorflow Container

Now that we have our tensorflow container, we can run it either interactively \(interactive slurm job using [singularity shell](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-shell)\) or as a batch job through the existing slurm sbatch command. I will demonstrate a simple sbatch script which will submit a job to launch the container and execute a python script which requires tensorflow.

The sbatch script seen below

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -J myTestSingularity
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
    #SBATCH --time=1:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem=14GB
    #SBATCH --partition=batch

    # Print key runtime properties for records
    echo Master process running on `hostname`
    echo Directory is `pwd`
    echo Starting execution at `date`
    echo Current PATH is $PATH

    # Launch singulairty container and execute python command to run tf_NN.py
    singularity exec $HOME/simgTest/tensorflowPy3.simg python $HOME/simgTest/tf_NN.py

Notice for previous workflows \(non-singularity based\), we would have loaded python3 and tensorflow, then had our sbatch script run `python3 myProgram`. Now, instead you run the `singularity exec` command with the desired singularity image \(containing tensorflow\), and provide the corresponding `python myProgram` as a command argument.

See below attached the sample batch script, and tf\_NN.py tensorflow python code to run as this demo.
