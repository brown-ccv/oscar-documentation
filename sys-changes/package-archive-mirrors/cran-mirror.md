# CRAN mirror

## Instructions:

In R, issue the following command (change `<package>` to the package you'd like to install):

```r
install.packages("<package>", repos="http://cran.services.brown.edu")
```

You may be prompted with two dialog windows:

`1) Would you like to use a personal library instead?`

`2) Would you like to use a personal library "< >"....`

Choose **Yes** for both of them.

## Notes

`http://cran.services.brown.edu` is a mirror server for `https://cran.r-project.org`
