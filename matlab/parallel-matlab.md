# Parallel Matlab

You can explore GPU computing through Matlab if you think your program can benefit from massively parallel computations:

* [MATLAB GPU Computing Support for NVIDIA CUDA-Enabled GPUs](http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/matlab-gpu.html)

Finally, parallel computing features like `parfor` and `spmd` can be used by launching a pool of workers on a node.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the Parallel Computing Toolbox by itself cannot span across multiple nodes, so make sure you request only 1 node to avoid wasting resources.
